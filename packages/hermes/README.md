# Portaler Hermes

Hermes is a maintenance bot that performs administrative tasks in the background.

Hermes is needed because it needs to perform actions while running as a single instance and keeps things running smooth. Originally, these tasks were run by the Discord bot simply because it usually runs as a single instance, but that's not really where they belong and those tasks should be abstracted to their own service.
