  An Albion Online Avalonion Roads shared mapping tool
</p>

# What it is

Portaler is a mapping tool for Avalonian Roads in Albion Online. It is fully Albion TOS compliant, because every user action is completely manual and nothing is automatically pulled or scraped from the Albion client or network packets. This tool simply provides a clean way for guilds/alliances share roads mapping internally.

The data we use to populate information is collected mostly from [Albion Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) as well as other manual crowd sourced methods.

Portaler can either be self hosted or we can provide hosting for your group through **in game currency**. We are not allowed to take real money for our services, but if you would like to support the project monetarily out of the kindness of your heart, please see the [Supporting](#supporting) section at the bottom.

## Monorepo

This is a monorepo utilizing [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/). Individual applications can be found in the [packages](/packages) folder.

## About the codebase

We have split up the project into 2 main workspaces. Main Packages and Shared.

### Main Packages

Contained under packages/\* folder

- [api-server](/packages/api-server)
  - The main API server
- [discord-bot](/packages/discord-bot)
  - The discord bot that allows roles to be assigned to users
  - Also contains the database migration files
- [fontend](/packages/frontend)
  - The React frontend

### Locally shared libraries

Contained under the shared/\* folder

- [data-models](/shared/data-models)
  - A collection of commonly shared data functions and models for the database & redis
- [types](/shared/types)
  - Just simply typescript type definitions shared across the different packages
- [universal-utils](/shared/universal-utils)
  - A collection of common utilities that can be used in either the frontend or node servers

## Running

If you would like to run the project for yourself, we provide Dockerhub images and you can find a docker-compose.yml file in the [docker](/docker) folder. If you would like to just run the project, you do not need to build the dockerfiles contained in the docker folder, just simply update the `.env.example` file with your variables, the variables in the docker-compose.yml and run:

    docker-compose up -d

More about [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [discord-bot](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mawburn/portaler-bot)

**Note:** Currently you will need to setup a [Discord developer account](https://discord.com/developers) and provide your own OAuth and Bot credentials. We do have plans on making this easier for people to self host in the future by disabling auth.

## Supporting

If you'd like to support the project, we would much rather you give your support to the [Albion Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/). This is the backbone of where we get our information, as well as virtually all other Albion fan based projects get their data.
